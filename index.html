                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Institutions across the globe, recognising the importance of education in one’s life, operate with flexible previous studies criteria and along with considering multiple other factors such as experience and extracurricular activities, amongst others. This encourages individuals hailing from a diversity of backgrounds to apply and gain access to best-in-class infrastructure, leading professors and a multicultural study environment. For instance, now, to enter into a master’s program in a specialised field like Arts Studies and Appreciation, an individual from sciences will also be considered if they harbour a genuine interest to study Arts. Further, with a myriad of scholarships such as MIT Scholarships, Aga Khan Scholarship and Inlaks Scholarships, finance is no longer a constraint for higher studies.</p>
